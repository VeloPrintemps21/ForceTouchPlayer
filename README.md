# Force Touch Player

Do you own a MacBook™?

Do you think the builtin Stereo Speakers™ are too limiting?

Have you realized your Force Touch™ Trackpad is not actually a huge glass button?

You see where I'm getting at. Introducing the Force Touch Player™ (not actually a trademark)

Play your favorite 8-bit tunes _in_ the trackpad, _with_ the trackpad, _on_ the trackpad. No speaker required!

## Wow, such vibration

- Download the binary
- Run the app
- Select a tune
- Click _Play_
- Don't ever take your finger off the trackpad!
- Get your ears close to the trackpad (it will not bite you)
- Sing the melody mentally, it may help

## Whoa, Black magic™?

No witchery here.

Only a very, very bad usage of Creative Programming™

> In Brazil, we don't say _Programming_, we say _Gambiarra_ and I think it's beautiful

It turns out since the 2015 MacBook™ Pro™ with Retina Display™, the trackpad is **not** a button. It is instead a vibration motor (vibracall), not very different from your Nokia 3310™.

Apple's engineers figured that managing the clicky feel via software would lead to a much better experience and fewer defects instead of the old, outdated™, mechanical switch.

So they did.

They also figured developers would find it appealing for their apps to interact with users with awesome Haptic Feedback™. Clicky things everywhere!

So they did.

They thought people would only use it for good, for the almighty UX™

So they did.

Do you realize what they created? Not only they made a noisy motor, but they also created a way to control it precisely (`NSHapticFeedbackPerformer`™)

You know what this means? They created a _speaker_

Well, not really, but we can make it sound like one

Are you sure?

This can't be right. Really?

### Is there even a limit?

Who knew trackpads had limits? I could only get it to work until around 220Hz (A3). If you are brave enough, maybe you can find a way to make it less bad™

### Adding a new tune

Any flute melody can work, as they only output a single note at a time.

Songs can be adapted from [`arduino-songs`](https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs). They are already curated and it is pretty much a task of copying and translating C arrays to Swift™
